I am a Research/ML Engineer at Continental Automotive. I live in Mexico between the cities of Guadalajara and Queretaro. I am a former student of Mathematics at Universidad de Guanajuato and Computer Science at Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas (CIMAT). I previously worked as a Software Engineer, Cybersecurity Engineer, and Research Engineer for TCS, Morgan Stanley, Abstra, and CIMAT.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Neural Networks Robustness, Responsible AI, and Perception Topics for autonomous mobility.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Sensor Fusion and Scene Graph Generation.
- 📚 I’m currently reading: An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and 📝 [Scene Graph Generation: A Comprehensive Survey]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05307](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00443)).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning projects.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Classic Computer Vision.
- 💬 Ask me about Machine Learning, Mathematics, C++, Linux, Responsible AI.
